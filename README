NOTE: Since auto-adding subdirectories wasn't working for Mac and is now disabled,
you need to manually add them to the CMakeLists.txt at the end, for any new apps
you add in the applications directory.

#===========================================
# FOR MacOSX User:

1. Install dependency libraries from Mac Port
sudo port install pkgconfig eigen3 cmake

2. Install OpenCV (http://opencv.org/downloads.html)
 - Use cmake and make to successfully build it
 - Set environment variable CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH in ~/.bash_profile to 
   point out where your OpenCVConfig.cmake locates, which should be in opencv folder
   Command:
     export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/Users/luncheng/data/code/cs799/opencv-2.4.9"

3. Install AprilTag
   Assume you are within apriltags folder, then
   Command:
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake ..

4. Find your Wixel device name in /dev
   Command:
     cd /dev

5. Update your Wixel device name in c code, which is in ./application/StreamData/StreamData.cpp.
   In line 74, update the DEVICE0, which by default is /dev/cd.usbmodel1411.

6. Go back to apriltags/build folder, then
   Command:
     make
     sudo make install
   
7. Execute the program
 - Plug in your wixel, and make sure the device name is the same as the one you type in in Stream.cpp
 - Go to applicaiton folder apriltags/build/applicaitons/StreamData
 - Copy configure file to this folder. 
   The configure file "AprilTagFinder.cfg", which by default is in apriltags/applications/StreamData
 - Execute the program
